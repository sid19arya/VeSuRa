## VeSuRa (Vector Supported Rasterization)

This github includes code for implementation and experimetnation with the shared encoder model for our paper/report: Hybrid Raster-Vector Loss for Vector Graphic Reconstruction.

### Usage

Based on the utils and data, the experiments notebook can be run directly in google collab (provided a GPU environment is available.)

Certain parameters, like wandb login and project name require changing based on your own setup. 

You also will need will need to change the location of the data in order to run, in my case I simply mount my google drive and grab the data from there. The exact same data object is available in the /data folder here, for reproduceability.
